//
// A per-process limiter for anonymous routes that cost money.
//
// javari-scrapbook had twelve routes anyone could call that reach a paid AI
// provider, a barcode lookup or an email sender. No account needed, no limit -
// so the ceiling on the bill was somebody's patience.
//
// DELIBERATELY IN MEMORY. A shared store would be better and needs Redis, which
// is a decision and a cost. This holds per serverless instance, so a determined
// caller spread across instances gets more than the stated limit - it raises the
// effort from trivial to deliberate, which is the honest claim.
//
// Returns a Response to send, or null to continue.
